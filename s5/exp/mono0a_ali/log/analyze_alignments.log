The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 22.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 84.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 8.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 40.7 hours of data, or 31.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,17.7,38)
